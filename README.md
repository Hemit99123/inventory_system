# inventory_system
Props to @SajjanKarn I used some chucks of his code to make this project but it is mostly me!
# RUN
Go to your CMD and type in npm i when in this project. Then run app.js! It should give you this:
# body-parser deprecated undefined extended: provide extended option app.js:28:17
# Server started listening on port: 4500
# h
when the file has ran sucessfully!
